## Submitting code

Any code changes must be submitted as a pull request. The description should explain what the code does and give steps to execute it. The pull request should also include tests.

## Code review process

The larger the pull request, the longer it takes to review and merge. Try to break large pull requests into smaller chunks that are easier to review and assemble.
Also, it's always helpful to have some context for your pull request. What was the purpose? Why is it important to you?
