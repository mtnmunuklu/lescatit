# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Issues

At our project, we take security issues and vulnerabilities seriously. We appreciate your efforts in responsibly disclosing any concerns you may have. To report a security issue, please email us at lescatit@gmail.com. We will work with you to investigate and address the issue promptly.

## Scope

This security policy applies to all aspects of our project, including the source code, documentation, and any other project assets.

## Supported Versions

We currently provide security updates and patches for the following versions of our project:

- [Version 1.0.0](https://github.com/mtnmunuklu/alterix/releases/tag/v1.0.0)

If you are using an older version, it is highly recommended to update to one of the supported versions.

## Vulnerability Disclosure

We follow a coordinated disclosure process to handle security vulnerabilities. When a vulnerability is reported to us, we will take the following steps:

1. We will acknowledge the receipt of the vulnerability report within 48 hours.
2. Our team will investigate and validate the reported vulnerability.
3. Once the vulnerability is confirmed, we will work diligently to develop and release a security patch.
4. We will provide regular updates on the progress of fixing the vulnerability.
5. After the security patch is released, we will publicly acknowledge the reporter's contribution (if desired) and the identified vulnerability (if appropriate).

## Bug Bounty Program

Currently, we do not offer a bug bounty program.

## Responsible Disclosure Guidelines

We kindly request that security researchers follow these guidelines when reporting security issues:

- Provide detailed information about the vulnerability, including steps to reproduce and any potential impact.
- Allow us a reasonable amount of time to investigate and address the reported issue before making any public disclosures.
- Do not exploit any vulnerability beyond what is necessary to demonstrate the issue's impact.
- Do not access or modify other users' data without their explicit consent.
- Respect the privacy and confidentiality of our users and their data.

We appreciate your cooperation in making our project more secure and protecting our users' information.
